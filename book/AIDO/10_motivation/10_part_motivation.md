# Introduction {#part:aido-introduction}


For a detailed description of the scientific objectives and outcomes please see [our recent paper about the AI-DO 1 at NeurIPS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02503.pdf).


### Quick links

* For an overview of the tasks, please see: [**Task overview**](#task_overview).

* For a description of the performance objectives of each task, please see: [**Rules**](#aido-rules).

* Where to get started with your code submission: [**Manual**](#manual)


In total the following ways of participating are offered. There are different tasks, different computational resource regimes and different performance categories in which to compete.

### Tasks

* [Lane following (LF)](#lf)
* [Lane following with dynamic vehicles (LFV)](#lf_v)
* [Lane following with dynamic vehicles and intersections (LFVI)](#lf_v_i)
* [Autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMOD)](#amod)

### Computational resources

* [Purist option - RaspberryPi](#computation)
* [Non-purist option - Additional Movidius stick](#computation) (still under development)
* [Remote option](#computation)
