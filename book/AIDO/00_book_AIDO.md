## Welcome to AI Driving Olympics! {#aido-welcome nonumber notoc}

Despite recent breakthroughs, the ability of deep learning and reinforcement learning to out performtraditional approaches to control physically embodied robotic agents remains largely unproven. 
To help bridge this gap, we created the “AI Driving Olympics” (AI-DO), a competition with the objective of evaluating the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence for mobile robotics. 
Based on the simple and well specified autonomous driving and navigation environment called “Duckietown,” AI-DO includes aseries of tasks of increasing complexity – from simple lane-following to fleet management. 
For each task, we provide tools for competitors to use in the form of simulators, logs, code templates, baseline implementations and low-cost access to robotic hardware. We evaluate submissions in simulation online, on standardizedhardware environments, and finally at the competition event.

Participants will not need to be physically present---they will just need to send their source code packaged as a Docker image.  There will be qualifying rounds in simulation, similar to the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge,
and we will make available the use of "robotariums," which are facilities that allow remote experimentation in a reproducible setting.

 - **AIDO 1** is in conjunction with NeurIPS Dec. 2018. 

 - **AIDO 2** is in conjunction with ICRA May 2019.

 - **AIDO 3** is in conjunction with NeurIPS Dec 2019.

## How to get help {#book-help nonumber}

If you are stuck try one of the following things:

 - Look through the contents of this documentation using the links on the left. Not that the "Parts" have many "Chapters" that you can see when you click on the Part title,
 - Look at the [questions](https://www.duckietown.org/questions) page on the website and see if someone has asked the question that you have (and if not feel free to ask it),
 - Join our [slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/duckietown/shared_invite/enQtNTU0Njk4NzU2NTY1LTQ2MDI4MTY1OTE1YjhjMTU4YTdkMDViMzJmNmJkNGQxN2U1ZGJlZjk2NGM0M2FiODY3YmQ2MTQ3MGM2MjY1ZTI),
 - If you are sure you actually found a bug, file a github issue in the appropriate repo.
