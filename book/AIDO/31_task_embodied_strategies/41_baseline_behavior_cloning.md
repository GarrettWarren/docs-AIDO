# Behavior Cloning {#embodied_bc status=ready}
In this part, you can find all the required steps in order to make a submission based on Behavior Cloning with Tensorflow for the lane following task using data varying from real data or simulator data. It can be used as a strong starting point for any of the [`LF`](#lf), [`LFV`](#lf_v), and [`LFVI`](#lf_v_i) challenges.

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: That you have made a submission with the [tensorflow template](#tensorflow-template).

Result: You win the AI-DO!

Clone the [baseline Behavior Cloning repository](https://github.com/duckietown/challenge-aido_LF-baseline-behavior-cloning):

    $ git clone -b master https://github.com/duckietown/challenge-aido_LF-baseline-behavior-cloning.git
        
    $ cd challenge-aido_LF-baseline-behavior-cloning

The code you find is structured into 5 folders.

  1. Teach your duckiebot to drive itself in `duckieSchool`.

  2. Sift through all the logs that can be used for training using `duckieLog`.

  3. Train your model using tf.keras based model in `duickieTrainer`.

  4. *(Optional)* Hold all previous models you generated in `duckieModels` in case you need it.

  5. Submit your submission via `duckieChallenger` folder.
