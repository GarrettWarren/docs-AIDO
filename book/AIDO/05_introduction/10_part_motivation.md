There are different challenges, different computational resource regimes and different performance categories in which to compete.

### Challenges

* [Lane following (LF)](#lf)
* [Lane following with dynamic vehicles (LFV)](#lf_v)
* [Lane following with dynamic vehicles and intersections (LFVI)](#lf_v_i)
* [Autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMOD)](#amod)

### Computational resources

* [Purist option - RaspberryPi](#computation)
* [Non-purist option - Additional Movidius stick](#computation) (still under development)
* [Remote option](#computation)
