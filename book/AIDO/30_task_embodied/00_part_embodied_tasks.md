# Strawman Solutions {#part:embodied status=ready}

We provide a set of templates (strawman) for solutions. These templates are fully functional solutions that don't do anything "smart". They will get you a valid score on the leaderboard but it's unlikely that it will be very good.Specifically, we provide the following strawman solutions:

 - [Minimal agent template](#minimal-template) is the most minimal feasible solution for `LF*` challenges,
 - [Tensorflow template](#tensorflow-template) for making a submission with a tensorflow model to the `LF*` challenges,
 - [Pytorch template](#pytorch-template) for making a submission with a Pytorch model to the `LF*` challenges,
 - [ROS template](#ros-template) for making a submission using the robot operating system to the `LF*` challenges,
